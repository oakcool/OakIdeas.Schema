OakIdeas.Schema
===============

[![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Paket.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OakIdeas.Schema.Core/)

A .Net implementation of the [www.schema.org](schema.org) effort.

This is a portable .net library that works from .NET 4 and up.

The object is quite simple:
  - Have 1 to 1 relationship with current definitions found in www.schema.org
  - Document all the code using the definition of the organization

The use:
  - Use this as a base for implenting SEO friendly sofware, and databases (As a guide).

The future:
  - Create other libraries that use this as a start and helps create for example MVC 
  extentions that spits out SEO friendly HTML 5, with little effort 
  i.e. @Html.Organization("Some Org", "Some address", "Some Contact") 

How you can help?
  - Fork it
  - Pick something not implemented, announce here
  - Push it back
  - Or, help making decisions on the implementation, since this is an attempt and by no 
  means is the full truth and only way of implementing. This means that with good arguments
  and reasoning, everything can and will be changed
  
Enjoy and contribute

Keep Coding!!!
